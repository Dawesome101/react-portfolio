        "description": "Solid Sky implements a player combat mode of which the player can toggle into at any time. It is complete with its own unique analog control system independent of the normal movement mode. The player character has full control of a functional, chainable attack system. There are literally dozens of attack combos classified by light, medium and heavy attack strings. Additionally, there are special moves and combo finishers such as the lunge kick, super kick, super punch, etc. The Animations themselves are selected from the Fighting Animset Pro asset available on the Unity Asset Store from the developer Kobold. The design, implementation, blending, animation controller, character controller and all its programming are my personal work.",
